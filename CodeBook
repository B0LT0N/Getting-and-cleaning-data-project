- This Code Book indicates all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

- Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

- Variables:
features <- features.txt : The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
activities <- activity_labels.txt : List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : Contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : Contains recorded features test data
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : Contains test data of activities code labels
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt: Contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
x_train <- test/X_train.txt: Contains recorded features train data
y_train <- test/y_train.txt :contains train data of activities’code labels
X: is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y: is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
Subject: is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
MergedData: is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function
TidyData: is created by subsetting MergedData, selecting subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

-Labels the data set with descriptive variable names:
Code column in TidyData renamed into activities
Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

-FinalData: is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity

-Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
